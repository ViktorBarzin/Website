What follows is a brief overview of selected projects. There are quite some more stuff that I am working/have worked that are worth checking out.

- Home Lab: Utilized a Dell R310 server to setup a virtual lab for learning purposes. Check out my blogpost on that [here](/blog/03-a-walk-down-infrastructure-lane/)

- https://spge-bg.com:  Rebuilt my high school website and automated the data migration process.

- Math problem solver: Built a math problem solver with REST-full API (https://goo.gl/BXMdKM)

- YouTube to MP3: A Django app which converts youtube videos to mp3 and sends an email with download link. All done asynchronously using RabbitMQ and Celery. (https://goo.gl/SRUrJD)
