Hi there! I'm Viktor.

I'm {{ current_year }} - 1998 years old and I'm currently doing my BSc in Computer Science at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/).

You can find me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/viktor.barzin), [twitter](https://twitter.com/ViktorBarzin) and [github](https://github.com/ViktorBarzin).


I'm all into information security. I love solving interesting and challenging problems and I also enjoy helping others learn new stuff.

In my free time I watch Formula 1, play chess and soon I'll be jumping out of planes

### <h3>What information can you find on this site?</h3>
The website will mostly be me sharing my experience with various technologies. I will try to post new articles every week with the technologies I've come across.

#### PS: The site is currently in development so new sections are to be added (e.g projects)
